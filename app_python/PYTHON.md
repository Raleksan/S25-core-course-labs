# Python Web Application

## Framework choice

I chose the `Flask` framework because I have a little experience with it, and this framework is one of the most common frameworks. 
`Flask` has all possible functionalities that can be used in web development.

## Best practices

- I have configured the `pre-commit` hooks (check the `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file).
- The `markdownlint` is used to check the documentation style.
- The code is formatted by `black` formatter, linted by `pylint`, statically checked by `mypy`.

## Testing

This application was tested manually by comparing the outputs with this [site](https://time.is/Moscow).
